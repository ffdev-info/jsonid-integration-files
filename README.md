Files used in the development of JSONID rulesets.

## Organization of files

The organization of this file is still a work in progress. Suggestions as to
a better way of documenting these files is appreciated.

Currently organized by format and sample, e.g.

```tree
integration_files/
├── json
│   ├── adobe-edge
│   ├── allotrope-simple-model
|   ├── ...
|   ├── ...
│   ├── unreal
│   ├── w3c-sparql
│   └── wacz
└── yaml
    └── sops
```

## JSONID

JSONID can be found in its [own repository][jsonid-1].

[jsonid-1]: https://github.com/ffdev-info/jsonid

## Finding samples

I have an open request to receive samples of JSON in your collections on an
[OPF blog][opf-1].

## ArchiveTeam and Wikidata

If you are able to, please create a record of undocumented formats in the
[Just Solve It wiki][justsolve-1]. I will also endeavor to create records
via this repository.
